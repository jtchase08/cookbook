# aka Silky Stovetop Mac and Cheese

RECIPE SERVES 1 AS MAIN DISH, 2-4 AS SIDE DISH

Ingredients
  * 1/4 lb (113 g) dry elbow pasta 
  * 1/3-1/2 cup (80-120 ml) milk 
  * 1-2 (15-30 g) tablespoons butter (depending on how rich you want it)
  * 1/2 cup packed (50 g) processed cheese (American cheese) torn into small pieces
  * 1/2 cup packed (50 g) any semi firm cheese(s), grated

Directions
  1. Boil water and cook pasta
  2. Don't start making cheese sauce until pasta is in boiling water
  3. In a cold pot, combine the milk (start with the smaller measurement above because you can add more later), cheeses, and butter
  4. Start melting on medium-high heat, **stirring constantly**.
    1. Once the sauce is totally melted and simmering, consider adding more milk if the sauce looks too thick, remembering it will thicken as it cools to eating temperature.
  5. Combine cheese sauce and pasta. Salt and Pepper to taste, and enjoy
