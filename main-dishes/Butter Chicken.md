# Butter Chicken

RECIPE SERVES 2 AS MAIN DISH, 4 AS SIDE DISH

Marinade Ingredients
- 1/2 cup plain yoghurt , full fat
- 1 tbsp lemon juice
- 1 tsp turmeric powder
- 2 tsp garam masala
- 1/2 tsp kashmiri chili powder (note 1)
- 1 tsp ground cumin
- 1 tbsp ginger, freshly grated
- 2 cloves garlic, crushed
- 1.5 lb chicken thigh fillets, cut into bite size pieces

Curry Ingredients
- 2 tbsp ghee, or 1 tbsp vegetable oil
- 1 cup tomato passata (aka tomato puree) (note 2)
- 1 cup heavy cream
- 1 tbsp sugar
- 1 1/4 tsp salt

To Serve, you have options
* Basmati Rice
* White Rice

Instructions
1. **Marinade:** Combine the Marinade ingredients with the chicken in a bowl. Cover and refrigerate overnight, or up to 24 hours (minimum 3 hrs).
2. **Cook chicken:** Heat the ghee (butter or oil) over high heat in a large fry pan. Take the chicken out of the Marinade but do not wipe or shake off the marinade from the chicken (but don’t pour the Marinade left in the bowl into the fry pan). 
3. Place chicken in the fry pan and cook for around 3 minutes, or until the chicken is white all over (it doesn’t really brown because of the Marinade).
4. **Sauce:** Add the tomato passata, cream, sugar and salt. Also add any remaining marinade left in the bowl. Turn down to low and simmer for 20 minutes. Do a taste test to see if it needs more salt.
5. Garnish with coriander/cilantro leaves if using.

Recipe Notes:
1. Kashmiri chili powder – Slightly milder than chili powder, it’s used a lot for the bright red color without adding too much heat.
2. Tomato passata - Pureed tinned tomatoes. Nowadays it is readily available in supermarkets, usually alongside pasta sauces. Called Tomato Puree in America.
3. A dutch oven is great for this recipe since you'll go from pan frying to simmering a sauce.
