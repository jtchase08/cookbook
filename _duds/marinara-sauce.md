# Marinara Sauce

## Ingredients

- 28 oz crushed tomatoes (1 can)
- 28 oz tomato puree (1 can)
- 3-5 cloves of garlic, finely chopped
- 1 yellow onion, finely chopped
- 1 tbsp tomato paste
- 1 sprig of fresh basil
- 1 tsp crushed red pepper flakes (optional)
- 1-2 tbsp unsalted butter (optional)
- 1 parmesan cheese rind (or a tbsp of grated parmesan cheese)
- 2 tbsp olive oil
- salt

## Directions

Add olive oil to a large sauce pan on medium heat. Add onions and saute until
translucent. Add garlic and saute for 1-2 minutes, until garlic is fragrant.
Mix in tomato paste and red pepper flakes. Add both cans of tomatoes and
basil. Mix well. Reduce heat to medium-low, cover pan, and simmer for 30
minutes or longer. Add parmesan cheese and butter about 5 minutes before ready
to eat. After removing from heat, remove the basil, and cheese rind and
discard. Salt to taste. For a less chunky sauce, cool for one hour and blend
with an upright or immersion blender. If you do not wait for it to cool
blending will turn the sauce orange, but it does not affect the taste.
