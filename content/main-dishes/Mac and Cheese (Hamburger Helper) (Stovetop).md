## aka Hamburger Helper Cheeseburger Mac Copycat

Ingredients
  * 1 pound ground beef
  * 1 tablespoon cornstarch
  * 1 tablespoon paprika
  * 1 1/2 teaspoons garlic powder
  * 1 1/2 teaspoons onion powder
  * 1 1/2 teaspoons salt
  * 1 teaspoon sugar
  * 1/2 teaspoon black pepper
  * 2 cups hot water
  * 1 1/2 cups milk
  * 2 cups dry cavatappi pasta or macaroni noodles
  * 2 cups grated cheddar cheese

Directions
  1. Heat a large skillet over medium high heat, then add the ground beef and break it up, cooking and stirring until the meat is no longer pink. Drain any remaining fat in the pan.
  2. Sprinkle the cornstarch, paprika, garlic powder, onion powder, salt, sugar, and pepper over the browned meat and stir well to evenly distribute the spices. Add the hot water, milk, and pasta, then bring to a boil. Cover with a lid, reduce heat and simmer for 8-11 minutes, or until the pasta is al dente.
  3. Sprinkle the grated cheddar cheese over the cooked pasta and stir until melted into the sauce. Remove from the heat, and let stand for a few minutes until the sauce thickens a bit. Garnish with freshly chopped parsley, if desired, then serve.
