# Crock Pot Shredded BBQ Beef

Ingredients
  * 2 - 3 Tbsp packed light brown sugar
  * 2 1/2 tsp paprika
  * 2 tsp garlic powder
  * 2 tsp onion powder
  * 1 1/2 tsp kosher salt
  * 1 tsp black pepper
  * 4 lb beef chuck roast
  * 2 Tbsp yellow mustard
  * 2/3 cup beef broth
  * 1 tsp liquid smoke (optional)
  * 3 - 4 Tbsp unsalted butter (sliced)
  * BBQ sauce of your choice

Directions
  1. Combine brown sugar, paprika, garlic powder, onion powder, salt and pepper in a small bowl. Set aside. Add chuck roast to slow cooker, drizzle with mustard and rub into the meat.
  2. Sprinkle with half of the rub. Rub into the meat, flip the roast over and rub the remaining rub into the meat. Pour in beef broth and liquid smoke (if using), being careful to pour it around the roast, not over it. You don't want to wash away that rub and mustard! Top with butter slices. Cover and cook on LOW for 8-10 hours, or until roast is fork tender.
  3. Remove roast from slow cooker to a large cutting board and shred, discarding large fat pieces. Drain cooking juices from the slow cooker and return shredded beef to the slow cooker.
  4. Add BBQ sauce to slow cooker and mix. Use desired amount of sauce.
