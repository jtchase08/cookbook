**Brining The Chicken**

Ingredients
  * 1 quart buttermilk
  * 1 cup water
  * 1 Tbsp kosher salt
  * 2 Tbsp Crystal Hot Sauce
  * ¼ cup maple syrup
  * ½ tsp whole black peppercorn
  * 1 bay leaf
  * 6 chicken legs
  * 4 chicken thighs

Directions
  1. Whisk together buttermilk, water, salt, hot sauce, maple syrup, peppercorns, and bay leaf in a large mixing bowl.
  2. Add chicken to the mixing bowl then cover and refrigerate for anywhere between 2 and 24 hours. 

**Frying The Chicken**

Ingredients
  * 3 cups peanut oil (or vegetable/canola oil)
  * 10 pieces chicken in brine
  * 3 cups flour 
  * 1 Tbsp salt
  * 1 ½ tsp black Pepper
  * 1 ½ tsp smoked Paprika
  * 1 tsp cayenne

Directions
  1. Heat peanut oil in a cast iron pan (or any deep heavy-bottomed pan) on medium high until the temperature reaches 350 degrees. Make sure the peanut oil is not so high up the edge of the pan that it overflows. Feel free to use a deep-fryer or air fryer if you have one.
  2. Remove chicken from brine and dry well on paper towels
  3. Whisk together flour, salt, pepper, paprika, and cayenne in a large mixing bowl.
  4. Dredge the chicken in flour, then back into the buttermilk brine, then back into flour, really mashing the seasoned flour into the chicken flesh. 
  5. Fry each piece for about 7 minutes, then flip, and fry for an additional 7, checking the oil temperature occasionally to make sure it never eclipses 350. Work in batches so the pan is not overcrowded—you never want any of the chicken pieces to overlap.
  6. Remove from oil, let drain on paper towels, and make sure internal temperature reads 160 degrees. 

**Garnishing the Chicken**

Ingredients
  * 2 Tbsp Butter
  * 2 Tbsp Milk
  * 1 ½ cups powdered sugar
  * 1 cup granulated sugar
  * 2 Tbsp cinnamon 
  * ½ cup Crystal hot sauce (vinegar-based hot sauce)
  * ½ cup Aunt Jemimah pancake syrup

Directions
  1. Heat butter and milk over low heat in a small sauce pot until butter is fully melted then gradually whisk in your powdered sugar and turn off the heat.
  2. In a medium mixing bowl, stir together your cinnamon and granulated sugar.
  3. In a bowl, whisk together your syrup and hot sauce.
  4. Place chicken on a sheet pan with a wire rack and pour warm glaze over the top.
  5. Dust with cinnamon sugar mixture and serve on top of your donut of choice. Drizzle in maple hot sauce.
