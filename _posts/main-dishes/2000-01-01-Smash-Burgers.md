Ingredients
  * Vegetable oil (for pan)
  * 1 pound ground beef chuck (20% fat)
  * Salt
  * American cheese
  * Buns (potato rolls recommended, use whatever)
  * Burger toppings

Directions
  1. Heat a cast-iron griddle or large heavy skillet over medium-high until very hot, about 2 minutes, then lightly brush with vegetable oil. 
  2. Divide ground beef into 4 equal portions (do not form patties).
  3. Working in batches if needed, place portions on griddle and smash flat with a spatula to form 4"-diameter patties (craggy edges are your friend). 
  4. Season liberally with salt and cook, undisturbed, until outer edges are brown, about 2 minutes. 
  5. Flip patties, season with salt, and place a slice of cheese on top of each patty. 
  6. Cook until cheese droops and burgers are medium-rare, about 1 minute.
  7. Serve patties on rolls with ketchup, mayonnaise, lettuce, and pickles.
