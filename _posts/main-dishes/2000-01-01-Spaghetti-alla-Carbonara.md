Ingredients
  * Salt
  * Fresh cracked black pepper
  * 2oz (340g) spaghetti pasta
  * 4.5oz (125g) pancetta
  * 4 eggs
  * 2oz (55g) grated pecorino cheese, plus extra for topping

Directions
  1. Fill a large pot with water and bring it to a rolling boil. Add a light amount of salt to the water, considering that the meat and cheese already contain a significant amount of salt. In this case, use about half of the salt that you would typically add. Then, add the pasta to the pot and cook it according to the instructions on the package.
  2. Cut meat into 1/2-inch cubes. Place the cubes in a large skillet over medium heat, and add a pinch of salt and pepper to the pan. Saut√© the meat for approximately 4-6 minutes until it becomes deeply browned and crispy. Then, turn off the heat.
  3. While the pasta is cooking, separate the eggs and place the yolks in a large mixing bowl. If you prefer a sauce with a slightly lighter consistency, you can add the white of one egg as well. Then, add the pecorino cheese and a generous sprinkle of black pepper to the mixing bowl. Whisk the eggs and cheese together thoroughly until they are well combined.
  4. When the pasta is al dente to your taste, transfer it to the bowl with the egg mixture, using either tongs or a slotted spoon. Vigorously stir the pasta until the egg yolks coat it completely. Next, add the pancetta and the fat from the skillet to the bowl and stir again to ensure that the sauce is evenly distributed. If you find the sauce too thick, you can add some of the hot pasta water to it to achieve your desired consistency.
  5. Serve immediately, topped with extra black pepper and grated pecorino on top if you like.
