Ingredients
* 2 (16-oz) packages frozen Classic Cheddar Pierogies, thawed
* 2 (15-oz) jars Alfredo sauce
* 3 cups chopped cooked chicken
* ¾ cup cooked chopped bacon
* 2 to 3 Tbsp Ranch dressing mix
* 1½ cups shredded cheddar cheese

Directions
1. Preheat oven to 375ºF. Lightly spray a 9×13-inch pan with cooking spray. Set aside.
2. In a large bowl, combine Alfredo sauce, chicken, bacon, ½ cup cheddar cheese and Ranch dressing mix. Add pierogies and toss to coat.
3. Pour pierogies into prepared pan. Top with remaining cheddar cheese.
4. Bake, uncovered, for 35 to 45 minutes.

Notes
* Can use turkey bacon instead of regular pork bacon.
* ¾ cup of bacon is approximately ¾ of a pound raw bacon.
* Can assemble the casserole ahead of time and refrigerate or freeze for later.
* To bake after freezing, thaw completely and bake as directed above.
* Can use rotisserie chicken for the cooked chicken.
* Can use Mrs. T’s Frozen Pierogies – they are in the freezer section near the frozen potatoes.
