# Dirt Pudding

Ingredients
  * 1 party size* package of Oreos, crushed
  * 8 oz cream cheese, softened
  * 1/4 c butter
  * 1 c powdered sugar
  * 3 c milk
  * 2 small boxes instant vanilla pudding
  * 1/2 tsp vanilla
  * 12 oz Cool Whip, thawed

Directions
  1. Cream together cream cheese, butter, powdered sugar, vanilla.
  2. In separate bowl mix milk and pudding. Chill until set.
  3. Fold in cool whip after pudding has set.
  4. Add cream cheese mixture.
  5. In large serving bowl, start with a layer of crushed oreos, and alternate between mixture and oreos

* We found that a regular size pack of oreos isn't quite enough. If you can't find a party size package, use 1.25-1.5 normal size packages
