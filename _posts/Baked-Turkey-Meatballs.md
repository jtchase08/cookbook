# Baked Turkey Meatballs

Ingredients
  * 1/3c grated Parmesan cheese
  * 1/3c Italian-seasoned breadcrumbs
  * 3 tbsp finely chopped fresh herbs (basil, parsley, or chives a combo)
  * 1 tsp kosher salt
  * 1/2 tsp garlic powder
  * 1/2 tsp onion powder
  * 1/2 tsp dried oregano
  * 1/4 tsp black pepper
  * 1/4 tsp red pepper flakes, optional
  * 1 lb 93% lean ground turkey
  * 1 large egg
  * 1 1/2 tbsp olive oil

Directions
  1. Preheat oven to 375F . Line a rimmed baking sheet with aluminum foil and coat with nonstick spray.
  2. In a large mixing bowl, add the cheese, bread crumbs, herbs, salt, garlic powder, onion powder, oregano, pepper, and red pepper flakes and stir well to combine. Add the turkey. In a small bowl, beat the egg, then add it to the meat mixture. With a fork or your fingers, mix just until combined, being careful not to compact the meat.
  3. With a scoop or spoon, scoop the meat and shape into 1 1/2-inch meatballs. Arrange on the prepared baking sheet. You will have about 20 meatballs total. Brush the tops of the meatballs with the olive oil.
  4. Bake for 15 minutes, or until the meatballs reach an internal temperature of 165 degrees F on an instant-read thermometer. As an alternate way to check, a meatball in the center of the baking sheet should be fully cooked through when cut in half.
  5. While the meatballs cook, warm the sauce and any other items youâ€™d like to serve them with (pasta, hoagie buns, 1rice, etc.). Serve the meatballs hot, topped with the sauce, cheese, herbs, and any other additions.
